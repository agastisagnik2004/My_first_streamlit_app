My First Streamlit App: IPL Matches Dashboard
This is an interactive data visualization app built using Streamlit and Plotly, focused on IPL (Indian Premier League) match data. It allows users to explore various match statistics such as:

Number of matches per season

Distribution of match results and toss decisions

Top teams by wins

Players with the most "Player of the Match" awards

Win margin analysis (runs/wickets)

Additionally, users can select any player from the sidebar to view their personalized performance stats, including:

Awards per season

Teams they won with when awarded

This project marks my first hands-on experience with data filtering, visualization, and dashboard design using Python in a web-friendly interface.
